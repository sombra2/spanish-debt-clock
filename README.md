# spanish-debt-counter

This is a simple script that calculates the public spanish debt using moving averages and linear regressions. Once the data is compiled and calculated it goes on a twitter bot account. It can be seen working at: https://twitter.com/deudapublicaes1

## Data

Until the moment I figure out a public API with the current debt date, some of the variables have to be updated by hand on a quarterly basis. The inline comments of the code shows details about this.
